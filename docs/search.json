    "text": "YODA is used as a secure data solution, where data generators can upload the filled templates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nMore information and a detailed ‘manual’ about YODA can be found on their website.\n\n\nData generators receive an email to register, after which they can access the dedicated website for data upload.\nThe main folder is called ‘research-enanomapper’ with a ‘temp_filesharing’ and a ‘non-excel-data’ folder within. There is also a README.txt file giving extra information on file naming. This information is also available under the naming convention tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly Momentum data generators, the responsible person from eNanomapper and data managers have access to this environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe temp_filesharing is a dump folder that provides a temporary collection place for Excel-based Momentum data that will subsequently be transferred into the online database of eNanomapper. It has sub-folders corresponding to separate templates/experiments. Templates should be uploaded into the fitting folder. If there is no fitting folder, one can simply create one (using lowercase letters and hyphens, if needed).\nFurthermore, the provision of descriptive metadata in Excel format about other types of data (e.g. microscopy, DNA sequencing etc.) is required. The metadata should contain a link to where these other data types are stored/will be made available (e.g. in Yoda1 or another well-established repository).\nThe non_excel_data folder is for non-tabular data. Its purpose is to provide a storing place for data that does not fit into eNanomapper as is (only the metadata that describes it). Data generators can create a sub-folder for their intended publication to store non-tabular data files there. In addition, there is a sub-folder for the rest of data that is not planned to be in a paper. It is possible to publish data straight from Yoda later, if desired."

Drafts can only be finalized if “data manager” is chosen, however, templates are still functioning when they are not finalized. Please remember that you can always reach out to a data steward at your institute or the responsible person at UU.\n You can link to your SOP, please provide a DOI in case it is published already.\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nHere can write some additional tips\n\n\n\nAfter downloading and filling in suitable templates according to your respective research, upload Excel files to the corresponding sub-folders (name as the template/experiment name). Naming convention is described under the corresponding tab.\nIf there is no sub-folder for a given template/experiment yet, please create it under the temp_filesharing folder.\nThere are no sub-folders in the non-tabular data folder yet so create one for your publication. There is an extra folder for data that will not be part of your publication. Please follow the same naming convention for traceability.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
