The use of additional repositories remains optional for all the researchers within MOMENTUM. When local changes are made to the data, the version on YODA always needs to be updated. \n\nAll data underlying publications need to be made available in YODA – both original and transformed data in the form of eNanomapper (ENM) templates; however, publishing the templates themselves is optional. \n\nData planned to be published can be uploaded to YODA separately from filled ENM templates. \nFilled in ENM templates can be uploaded to YODA whenever they are ready, waiting until the publication is out is not necessary. \nUnpublished data should also be uploaded to YODA whenever it is ready. This data does not have to be in ENM templates. \n\n### Timeline\nIf data of the MOMENTUM projects is published in a paper, the underlying data should be uploaded in YODA in ENM templates and original formats wherever it is possible and otherwise in other formats preferably before but **maximally 2 months** after the publication. \nFor papers that are **already published** we ask the authors to upload the data in ENM templates and original formats wherever it is possible and otherwise in other formats before **01-04-2025**. \nFor data generated in MOMENTUM1.0 (or in MOMENTUM2.0) and **not used in publications**, we ask all data generators to upload this to YODA before **01-07-2025**. \nAll data generated in **MOMENTUM2.0** should be made available before **01-07-2026**. \nIf you foresee issues with this timeline, contact the MOMENTUM coordinator. \n\n~~*Accessing YODA and ENM is possible after these deadlines up to at least 5 years*~~. \n\n### Minimal requirements \nThe minimum data to be reported are **all data underlying publications**. Preferably though, both raw and processed data should be made available. The level of \"rawness\" is determined by the data owner, based on their expertise and understanding of the data. If providing raw data requires substantial effort and is deemed unfeasible within the given project timeline the data owner should contact the MOMENTUM coordinator. When no actual data can be made public, at least basic metadata describing the research methodology should be provided.\n\nAs much a possible of MOMENTUM data should be available in ENM, structured as a database. Therefore, this data should be submitted in the ENM templates. Data that can’t be made available in ENM templates should be made available in YODA. For ENM, the data generators need to provide their filled templates in YODA. \nFolder structure in YODA should be simple and generic and it can be advised later on an individual bases. Folders can be structured per work package, with separate folders per publication, containing folders of ENM templates and all other formats (see image 1. below for inspiration).\n\n![](/images/simple_datapack.png \"1. Simple folder structure for publications within work packages\")\n\nIf restricted access is chosen under specific licenses when publishing, only metadata will be accessible.\n\nThe two ‘streams’ of MOMENTUM data (ENM and YODA) can be linked on the [website](https://momentummicroplastics.nl/) of MOMENTUM or the [community](https://zenodo.org/communities/momentum/records?q=&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=newest) on ZENODO.\n\n### Openness\nAs long as openness is legally and ethically permissible, MOMENTUM data should be made ==open access== after an embargo period (in this case, after publications). However, ==restricted access== may be chosen by the data owners (researchers), i.e. deciding on giving access to owned data on a case-by-case basis. In such cases, an ==access protocol and data-sharing agreements== need to be prepared to ensure that access to the data can be provided in a timely manner. These documents should be arranged and managed by the data owner.\n\n### Route\nData generators will get access to YODA to place their data in YODA. With the checklist below they inform the data steward of MOMENTUM on details. The data is placed in ENM templates for export to eNanomapper. The data steward will facilitate the export to eNanomapper. The ENM templates and, if applicable, other templates/formats will be stored in the YODA vault. Data gets a DOI and, if applicable, data will be made available via open access. In case of restricted access, a data sharing protocol needs to be arranged - there are usually institutional guidelines available to be consulted.\nThe UU data steward is available to assist with the ENM templates and other steps.\n\n### Data checklist\n\n| Type of data generated | Data storage |\n| :---------- | :----------- |\n| • Experimental, Tabular Data – xls, csv <br><br> e.g. Lab data (raw & processed)  | data into enanomapper (ENM) template <br><br> » store templates together with original data in YODA |\n| • Experimental, Non-Tabular Data <br><br> e.g. Output of imaging techniques, PCR | store all formats in YODA |\n| • Non-Experimental Data <br><br> e.g. Documentation, SOPs, literature reviews, modelling output\t| store all formats in YODA|\n|<strong>Openness</strong> <br><br> • Open <br><br> • Restricted - metadata is open |<strong>Required documents</strong> (in case of restricted access) <br><br> • protocol available for arranging data access <br><br> » e.g. contact person appointed, data-sharing agreements in place – usually institutional guidelines to be consulted|\n|<strong>Timeline</strong> <br><br> • Already published data » at latest within 2 months (01-04-2025)<br><br> • Upcoming papers » maximally 2 months after the publication <br><br> • MOMENTUM 1 data » at latest 1st July 2025 <br><br> • MOMENTUM 2 data » at latest 1st July 2026|\n\n\n\n### YODA\n\n**YODA** is used in two ways within MOMENTUM. First, as a forum for file exchange to get suitable data into ENM (as direct upload is not supported). This means that ENM templates (filled by data generators) are uploaded here. Furthermore, Yoda is the chosen repository for long-term archiving and publishing as it is especially suitable for large files and managed by UU, who coordinates MOMENTUM. \n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=\"false\" appearence=\"simple\"}\nMore information and a detailed ‘manual’ about YODA can be found on their [website](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/yoda/guide-to-yoda).\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip icon=\"false\" appearence=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\"}\n## Good to know\nApart from storage, data can also be published straight from YODA.\n:::\n\nData generators receive an email to register, after which they can access the dedicated [website](https://dgk.yoda.uu.nl/) for data upload.\n\nThe main folder is called **‘research-enanomapper’** with an **‘enm_filesharing’** and an optional **‘for_publication’** folder within.

It has sub-folders corresponding to separate experiments. Templates should be uploaded into the fitting folder.
