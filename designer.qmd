##                                      - *This tab is under construction* - 


#### How to design a template that fits your data

-   Navigate to the [**template designer**](https://enanomapper.adma.ai/templates) of Momentum
-   Click on "**Create new draft**"
-   Can also browse **Finalized** and **Draft Blueprints** to see templates designed by others

When creating a new draft, a sequence of sheets pops up that need to be populated with information about your data.


![](/images/createnewdraft.png "Create a draft")

Please *provide a name* for your template, your name as author and your affiliation or project for the acknowledgement.


![](/images/1welcome.png "Welcome")

*Choose your role*. Drafts can only be finalized if "*data manager*" is chosen, however, templates are **still functioning** when they are not finalized. 

Please remember that you can always reach out to a data steward at your institute or the responsible person at UU.


![](/images/2method_v2.png "Experimental method")

You can *link to your SOP*. 

1.  Please provide a DOI in case it is published already and/or describe your protocol.
2.  List and specify your *experimental factors*, for instance: dose, time of measurement, replicates, compartment measured etc. Think of variables that are known beforehand and varied intentionally. 
3.  Tick the applicable *controls* as well.
4.  Choose a study *type* and *class* of experiment that is most fitting. 


![](/images/3results_v2.png "Results")

In the Results tab you can choose what *output you would like to report*. 

1.  Please *describe* your results.
2.  Choose all applicable options for *type of data* you want to make available. The category "Other" will not generate a sheet in your excel template though.
3.  Please fill in *variables* you want to report (in the example on the screenshot, raw and processed data is made available). 

Think of for instance: 

-   absorbance as raw data
-   cell viability and fold change as processed data. 

Clicking on the little cross in front of variables, you can specify which experimental conditions refer to your reported results.


![](/images/4methodparam_v2.png "Method parameters")

List your *method parameters*. 

You can think of for instance: cell line details, culture conditions, information on the medium, environment etc.

You can provide hints about your variables if you click the little cross in front of the parameter names.


![](/images/4sample.png "Sample details")

The sample fields will largely be ignored so you can leave this tab as is. The material sheet is uniform across templates.


![](/images/5sampleprep.png "Sample preparation")

List applicable variables for your *sample preparation*.

You can think of for instance: dispersion and dispersion agent.


![](/images/6proven.png "Provenance")

On this tab you can highlight which *project and work package* you are part of.


![](/images/7layout.png "Layout")

Choose a *layout* type.

-   The *dose response* layout is appropriate when there are a number of experimental factors, e.g. concentration, time, as well as a single set of parameters like instrument, medium, temperature, cell type.
-   The *physchem* layout is appropriate when there are no experimental factors (but there could be multiple set of parameters like instrument, medium, temperature).


![](/images/finalize.png "Finalize")

You can finalize your template if you chose a 'data manager' role on the first tab earlier. Alternatively, ask a data person to look at your draft template and finalize it for you. 

This step is **not mandatory for having a functional template**. You can very well use draft templates as well. Click save.

Now your newly designed template should be available either under Finalized or Draft Blueprints in the Desinger.
