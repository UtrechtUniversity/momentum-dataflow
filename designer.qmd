#### How to design a template that fits your data

-   Navigate to the [**template designer**](https://enanomapper.adma.ai/templates) of Momentum.
-   Click on "**Create new draft**"
-   Can also browse **Finalized** and **Draft Blueprints** to see templates designed by others

When creating a new draft, a sequence of sheets pop up that need to be populated with information about your data.

Choose your role. Drafts can only be finalized if "data manager" is chosen, however, templates are still functioning when they are not finalized. 
Please remember that you can always reach out to a data steward at your institute or the responsible person at UU.

## Tip
Here can write some additional tips
:::

-   After downloading and filling in suitable templates according to your respective research, upload Excel files to the corresponding sub-folders (name as the template/experiment name). Naming convention is described under the [**corresponding tab**](/naming.qmd).
-   If there is no sub-folder for a given template/experiment yet, please create it under the temp_filesharing folder.
-   There are no sub-folders in the non-tabular data folder yet so create one for your publication. There is an extra folder for data that will not be part of your publication. Please follow the same naming convention for traceability.
