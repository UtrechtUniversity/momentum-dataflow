#### How to design a template that fits your data

-   Navigate to the [**template designer**](https://enanomapper.adma.ai/templates) of Momentum.
-   Click on "**Create new draft**"
-   Can also browse **Finalized** and **Draft Blueprints** to see templates designed by others

When creating a new draft, a sequence of sheets pop up that need to be populated with information about your data.

Please provide a name for your template, your name as author and your affiliation or project for the acknowledgement.

Choose your role. Drafts can only be finalized if "data manager" is chosen, however, templates are still functioning when they are not finalized. 
Please remember that you can always reach out to a data steward at your institute or the responsible person at UU.
